  Preamble
************

The preamble is mostly universal for the repositories linked herein.

This is part of multiple notes about my *personal* setup of various Linux and BSD distributions. 
Some are used as desktops or servers or as virtual machines and containers. 
Each has a flavour and tweaks I will document in these lab notes.

- `Setup CentOS Linux as Server <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_centos_linux_as_server/>`__
- `Setup Debian Linux as Server <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_debian_linux_as_server/>`__
- `Setup Debian Linux as Workstation <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_debian_linux_as_workstation/>`__
- `Setup Fedora Linux as Workstation <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_fedora_linux_as_workstation/>`__
- `Setup FreeBSD as Workstationm <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_freebsd_as_workstation/>`__
- `Setup macOS as Workstation <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_macos_as_workstation/>`__
- `Setup Proxmox as Hypervisor <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_proxmox_as_hypervisor/>`__
- `Setup Windows 11 as Workstation <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_windows_11_as_workstation/>`__

Additionally there some common components and setup.

- `Manage configuration with GNU stow <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/manage_configuration_with_stow/>`__ 
- `Setup Python for Development <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_python_for_development/>`__ 
- `Setup Terminal and Shell <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_terminal_and_shell/>`__ 
- `Setup Visual Studio Code <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_visual_studio_code/>`__ 

I also have a crude utility to syncronize and 
`manage GitHub repositories <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/manage_github_repos/>`__
with these notes sufficient for my personal needs.

We are all different with different knowledge and foundation,
so I appologize in advance if steps are missing or skipped.

  Introduction
****************

A definite better way than manual steps
is to use Ansible_  (or similar),
and I will get there eventually.

Install prefered Terminal and Shell
===================================

This topic has its own page:
`Setup Terminal and Shell <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_terminal_and_shell/>`__.

Install Visual Studio Code
--------------------------

The official guide is
`here <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac>`__.

Finalize installation by following 
`Setup Visual Studio Code <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_visual_studio_code/>`__.
