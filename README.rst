************
  Preamble
************

The preamble is mostly universal for the repositories linked herein.

This is part of multiple notes about my *personal* setup of various Linux and BSD distributions. 
Some are used as desktops or servers or as virtual machines and containers. 
Each has a flavour and tweaks I will document in these lab notes.

- `Setup CentOS Linux as Server <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_centos_linux_as_server/>`__
- `Setup Debian Linux as Server <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_debian_linux_as_server/>`__
- `Setup Debian Linux as Workstation <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_debian_linux_as_workstation/>`__
- `Setup Fedora Linux as Workstation <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_fedora_linux_as_workstation/>`__
- `Setup FreeBSD as Workstationm <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_freebsd_as_workstation/>`__
- `Setup macOS as Workstation <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_macos_as_workstation/>`__
- `Setup Proxmox as Hypervisor <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_proxmox_as_hypervisor/>`__

Additionally there some common components and setup.

- `Manage configuration with GNU stow <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/manage_configuration_with_stow/>`__ 
- `Setup Terminal and Shell <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_terminal_and_shell/>`__ 
- `Setup Visual Studio Code <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/setup_visual_studio_code/>`__ 

I also have a crude utility to syncronize and 
`manage GitHub repositories <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/manage_github_repos/>`__
with these notes sufficeint for my personal needs.

We are all different with different knowledge and foundation,
so I appologize in advance if steps are missing or skipped.

Documents my personal setup.

At a later point I will use GNU Stow to manage configuration.

Install prefered Terminal and Shell
